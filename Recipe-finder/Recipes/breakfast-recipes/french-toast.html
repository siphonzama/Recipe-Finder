    <h2>Duration: 20 mim</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>loaf white farmhouse bread</li> 
        <li>4 tbsp smooth peanut butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>50ml whole milk</li>
        <li>pinch of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 tbsp condensed milk</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>step 1</h3>
        <p>
            Cut the loaf of bread into 8 slices, about 3.5cm thick, then remove the crusts from each slice (blitz these in a food processor to make breadcrumbs then freeze to use in another recipe). Spread the peanut butter over 4 slices of bread, then sandwich with the remaining slices and press down firmly around the edges to seal.
        </p>
    <h3>step 2</h3>
        <p>
            Whisk the eggs, sugar, milk, cinnamon, vanilla and a pinch of salt together in a shallow dish. Heat a frying pan over medium heat, then pour in the oil. Briefly dunk the bread in the egg mixture, turning to coat on both sides. Shake off any excess, then fry for 3-4 mins. Flip over and repeat until golden on both sides, then remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper (youâ€™ll need to do this in batches). To serve, drizzle over the condensed milk.
