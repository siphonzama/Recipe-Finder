        Tips for Perfect Cookies:
        Softened butter: Make sure your butter is softened to room temperature for smooth creaming.
        Don't overmix: Overmixing the dough can lead to tough cookies.  

    </p>
    

    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>
        Chill the dough: For thicker, chewier cookies, chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before baking.
        Use a cookie scoop: For uniform cookies, use a cookie scoop.
        Don't overbake: Overbaked cookies will be dry.
        Cool on a rack: Let cookies cool on a wire rack to prevent them from becoming soggy.
