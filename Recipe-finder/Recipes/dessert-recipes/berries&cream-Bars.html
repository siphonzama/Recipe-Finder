    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and position rack in center. Lightly grease bottom of a 9-inch square cake pan. Line bottom with parchment paper. Grease and lightly flour parchment and sides of pan.
        Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix butter and oil at medium speed until well combined, about 1 minute. 
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
            Mix in sugar at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Mix in egg whites in 2 or 3 additions at medium speed until well combined, scraping bowl well after each addition. Mix in 1 teaspoon vanilla and the almond extract.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Mix in about 1/3 of flour mixture at low speed. Mix in 1/3 cup milk; scrape bowl well. Repeat, alternating flour mixture and milk, until fully incorporated and batter is smooth.
</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Spread batter in an even layer in prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, about 30 minutes.
</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula or a knife around edge of cake and invert onto a wire rack. Remove parchment and let cool completely.
</p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Using a large serrated knife, halve cake horizontally to make two layers. Transfer one layer, cut side up, to a platter. Top with 1/2 cup jam, spreading evenly. Top with second cake layer, cut side down Meanwhile, for berry cream, purée remaining 2/3 cup jam in a blender or mini food processor until very smooth.
</p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat cream at medium speed until it begins to thicken, about 1 minute. Mix in marshmallow creme at medium-high speed until soft peaks form. Mix in puréed jam and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla at low speed until well combined. (If needed, fold whipped cream by hand to more evenly incorporate jam.) Frost top and sides of cake with berry cream.
</p>

    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>For garnish, crush freeze-dried berries with a mortar and pestle (or your hands) into a mixture of small pieces and powder; sprinkle over cake. Cut cake into 12 pieces. Chill in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 2 days.
