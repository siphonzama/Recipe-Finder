    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <h4>Prepare the Crust:</h4>
    <p>
        Cream the softened butter and caster sugar together until light and fluffy.
    Beat in the egg until well combined.
    Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together.
    Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until a dough forms.
    Press the dough evenly into a tart tin.
    Prick the base of the pastry with a fork (docking).  
    </p>

    <p>Blind bake at 180°C (350°F) for about 15-20 minutes, or until lightly golden.</p>
    
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <h4>Prepare the Filling:</h4> 
    <p>Heat the milk and cinnamon stick (if using) in a saucepan until it almost boils. Remove the cinnamon stick.
    In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cornflour, and egg.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Gradually pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.
    </p>

    <p>
        Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens.
    </p>

    <p>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract and butter.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <h4>Assemble and Serve:</h4>
    <p>
        Pour the warm filling into the pre-baked crust.
        Sprinkle generously with ground cinnamon.
        Allow the milk tart to cool completely and set before serving.
        Refrigerate before serving.
    </p>

    <h5>Key Tips: <br />
    Blind Baking: Blind baking the crust helps prevent it from becoming soggy.  <br />
    Preventing Lumps: Whisking constantly while adding the hot milk to the egg mixture is crucial for a smooth filling.  <br />
    Cooling: Allow the milk tart to cool completely for the filling to set properly.
