    </div>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li> 
        <li>A pinch of salt</li> 
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Combine Ingredients: <br />
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, whole milk, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt until the sugar is dissolved.
    </p>
    

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Chill the Mixture: <br />
        Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight. This step is crucial for achieving a smooth and creamy texture.  
    </p>
    

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Churn the Ice Cream: <br />
        Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. This usually takes about 20-30 minutes.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Freeze: <br />
        Once the ice cream has reached a soft-serve consistency, transfer it to an airtight container.
        Freeze for at least 2-4 hours, or until firm.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Serve: <br />
        Scoop and enjoy!<br />
        Tips and Variations:
        For a richer flavor: Use vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla extract.
        Add mix-ins: Once the ice cream is churned, you can fold in your favorite mix-ins, such as chocolate chips, chopped nuts, or fruit pieces.
    </p>
        

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Fruit variations:<br />
        Mash fresh fruit, like strawberries or raspberries, with a little sugar, and swirl it into the ice cream before freezing.<br />
        Chocolate variation:<br />
        Add cocoa powder to the mixture for a chocolate ice cream. You can also melt chocolate and swirl it into the ice cream.
    </p>


    <p>Caramel variation: Swirl in caramel sauce while transferring the ice cream to the container for freezing.</p>
