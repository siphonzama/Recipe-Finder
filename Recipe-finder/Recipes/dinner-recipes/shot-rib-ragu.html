    <ol>

        <li>2.5 tablespoons (38g) vegetable oil </li>
        <li>1.5 lbs (681g) bone-in beef short ribs (about 3 short ribs, depending on size)</li> 
        <li>1 lb (454g) beef chuck roast, cut into 1 inch chunks </li> 
        <li>Kosher salt and pepper, to taste </li>

        <li>3-4 large carrots, peeled and very finely minced</li> 
        <li>4 ribs celery, finely minced</li> 
        <li>3 cloves garlic, very finely chopped</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) tomato paste</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons (30g) harissa paste, optional </li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons (30mL) balsamic vinegar, (plus more for finishing)</li> 
        <li>2 cups (473mL) red wine, preferably on the dryer side like a Beaudoux</li> 
        <li>2.5 cups (591mL) beef stock </li> 
        <li>15 sprigs thyme</li> 
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>  
        <li>1-2 lbs (454-908g) pappardelle, or fettuccine</li> 
        <li>1 cup (122g) Pecorino Romano, grated (plus more for finishing)</li> 
        <li>1.5 cups basil leaves, roughly torn</li> 
    </ol>

    <h4>Directions: </h4>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C).  Place your grape tomatoes on a baking sheet lined with foil. Then, using a kitchen torch, char your tomatoes until the skins peel back, the tomatoes have softened a bit and they’ve been lightly blackened. Alternatively, you can use your broiler set to high for about 3-5 minutes or until nicely charred. Using paper towels, grab a few tomatoes at a time and rub them together to remove the skins. Optionally, blend in a blender until as fine as possible. You can also leave them whole if you wish, they’ll break apart from the braise, I prefer to blend them for a more even consistency. 
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Set a 7-8 quart heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven over medium high heat then add your vegetable oil. Season the meat on all sides with salt and pepper. Once the oil is hot, add your meat in batches, being sure not to overcrowd the pot, and sear for 2-3 minutes per side until all sides are evenly browned. Repeat until all meat has been seared. Remove meat to a sheet tray and set to the side.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Reduce the heat to medium, add more oil if necessary, and toss in your onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Season to taste with salt and sweat, stirring occasionally. Once the vegetables have begun to soften, about 2 minutes, add in your tomato paste and harissa paste. Stir the mixture and caramelize until the color darkens slightly, about 1-2 minutes. Crush the grape tomatoes with your hands and add to the pot. 
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Increase the heat to high then add your red wine, beef stock, and balsamic vinegar. Once it comes to a boil, drop the heat to low and nestle in your seared meat (bone side down). Generally you want the liquid to cover up at least ¾ of the way up the meat once it’s all been added. Tie together the thyme and bay leaves using butcher’s twine and add to the pot. Once simmering, cover with a lid and place in the preheated oven for 3-3.5 hours or until the meat is fork tender.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Gently remove your meat to a medium sized mixing bowl. Remove the bone and gelatinous membrane from the short ribs. Discard your thyme and bay leaves. Using your hands shred the meat as finely as possible. Alternatively, if it is too hot, use a large metal spoon, pressing and twisting the meat, until you achieve a similar result. Once shredded, fold the meat back into your pot of sauce until thoroughly combined. If the sauce seems to dry, add more beef stock, about 2-3 tablespoons at a time, until you reach your desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Fill a 4-6 quart pot with water and set over high heat until it comes to a boil. Salt your pasta water aggressively - it should taste like the ocean. Cook your pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain, making sure to reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, and return the cooked pasta to its original pot. 
    </p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
        Add half of the ragu to the pasta pot and toss until well coated. Use half the sauce if you cooked 1 lb of pasta and the full amount if you cooked 2 lbs. Incorporate 1-2 tablespoons of pasta water at a time to help emulsify. Stir in your grated Pecorino Romano and basil leaves until everything is evenly distributed. Once thoroughly combined, plate the pasta and top with more Pecorino Romano, black pepper, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Serve and enjoy.
