    <h4>Pad Thai Sauce Method:</h4>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>
        In a small bowl, cover tamarind pulp with boiling water and mix until combined and rehydrated.  Press through a mesh sieve into a medium mixing bowl. 
        To the same medium mixing bowl containing the tamarind, add palm sugar, fish sauce, and black soy. Whisk until incorporated.

    <h4>Pad Thai Method:</h4>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>
        Place dried shrimp into the food processor and process at high speed into a powder.
        Cook the Pho Noodles to package directions, with the seasoning packets, then drain and set aside.
        Slice chicken breasts into ⅓” slices. In a sheet pan or bowl, toss together with kosher salt, ground white pepper and cornstarch. Add soy sauce and toss together.
        In a large wok over high heat, add vegetable oil and once shimmering add chicken, spreading out to sear and get color on one side,  about 2-3 minutes. Then stir fry to cook through another 2 minutes and then set to the side.
    </p>

    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>
        Add more oil to the wok over medium-high. Once very hot, add in shallots and stir fry 2-3 minutes, then add in garlic, zha cai, shrimp powder, stir frying another 2-3 minutes.
        Add in the noodles followed by the pad thai sauce. Increase heat to high and stir vigorously until fully incorporated.
        Reduce heat to medium-high. Push noodles to one side, add in beaten eggs and let cook for 30 seconds before scrambling.
        Toss eggs with noodles and add in Chinese garlic chives, mung bean sprouts, and cooked chicken. Stir fry until chives begin to wilt.
        Remove from heat. Plate with crushed peanuts, fresh mung bean sprouts, and lime wedges. Serve and enjoy.
