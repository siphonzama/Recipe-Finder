    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1x 1.5 pound (680g) 1-inch thick boneless ribeye steak, fat cap removed and diced, to be rendered and used for cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste *optional</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Spicy chili crisp, to taste</li>
    </ol>
    

    <h4>Method:</h4>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>
        Pre-heat a 10-inch stainless-steel pan or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the diced fat cap to the pan to render the fat and remove when your pan is coated in a nice, thin layer of oil. Increase the heat to medium-high.
        Pat the ribeye steak dry with a paper towel. Season one side of the steak generously with kosher salt and, optionally, with fresh cracked black pepper.
        Add the steak to your pan or skillet and press down for full contact. Season with kosher salt to taste.  Sear for 2-3 minutes per side until internal temperature of 135°F (60°C). The steaks should be medium rare, but if they’re still too rare, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, flipping constantly, until they reach medium-rare. 
    </p>

    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>
        Remove the steaks from the pan and set them on a cutting board to rest, about 5-10 minutes.
        While the steak rests, add the egg to your pan or skillet, season to taste with salt, and fry to your liking. If there is enough fat in the pan, tilt the pan toward you and using a spoon, baste the egg whites with the fat for about 30 seconds until cooked.
        Place the egg on top of the steak and drizzle with chili crisp to taste. You could replace the chili crisp with any hot sauce you like.  Serve and enjoy.
