    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>4 Shishito peppers</li>
        <li>¾ cup (113g) all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 cup (160g) cornmeal</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5g) fine sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon (3g) Cajun or Creole seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon (3g) garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon (1g) fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon (1g) baking soda</li>
        <li>½ cup (118ml) whole milk</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons (45g) vegetable oil</li>  
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 small or 1 large shallot, finely minced </li>
        <li>2 quarts (2L) vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Method: </h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Place a small wire rack on top of your stove and turn the heat on to medium-high. Char your Shishito peppers for 2-3 minutes, give each pepper a quarter turn and char 2-3 more minutes, until blackened in small spots. You can also do this on a grill or with a kitchen torch. Remove their stems, and optionally remove the seeds. Chop them finely and set aside. 
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        To make your batter, in a large mixing bowl whisk together your dry ingredients until thoroughly combined. Then add in your remaining wet ingredients and whisk together until incorporated. If your batter is looking thin, let it rest for 5 minutes and the cornmeal should soak up any excess moisture and thicken up a little bit.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        In a 6-8 quart heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat your oil to 350°F (176°C).  Once your oil is to temperature, using a spoon or tablespoon-sized cookie scoop, drop 4-8 scoops of batter at a time into the hot oil. Fry until a beautiful golden brown, and bubbling has noticeably subsided, turning as needed for even browning, 2-3 minutes. Drain on a small paper towel-lined sheet pan and season with salt to taste immediately. Repeat with the remainder of your batter. Serve and enjoy as is, or optionally serve with something like a remoulade, garlic mayo, or flavored dipping sauce of your choice.
