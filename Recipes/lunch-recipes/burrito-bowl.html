    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <h4>For the Pickled Red Onion</h4>
    <h5>Step 1</h5>
    <p>
        Add sliced onion to a 1-quart heatproof jar or container.
        In a medium saucepan over medium high heat combine water, vinegar, and salt. When the mixture begins to boil, remove from heat and pour over the red onions to cover.
        Let the mixture come to room temperature, uncovered. Once cooled, cover with a tight fitting lid and refrigerate. The pickled onions can be stored in the fridge for a few months. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>For the Rice</h4>
    <h5>Step 2</h5>
    <p>
        Rinse your rice thoroughly under cold water, until the water runs clear. Strain the rice dry and place in your rice cooker. Cover with 3 cups of water, close the lid and cook as directed by the manufacturer.
        To follow the nutritional values listed above serve the rice cooked as is up to this point. For added flavor, stir in the cilantro, butter, lime zest and juice until evenly combined. Season with salt to taste and keep warm until ready to serve.
    </p>
    
    <h4>For the Chicken</h4>
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    <p>
        Strain the liquid from the chipotle in adobo can into a bowl. Roughly chop the peppers and add those back into the liquid along with the salt and garlic. Stir to combine.
        To a large bowl add the chicken thighs and pour the chipotle in adobo marinade over the chicken, stirring to evenly coat all the chicken. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, but up to overnight.
        Heat a cast iron pan, grill pan or grill over medium high heat. Evenly coat the pan with vegetable oil or cooking spray. Once the pan is nearly smoking, add your chicken, in batches, to avoid overcrowding. Sear for 2-3 minutes per side, or until deeply golden brown and beginning to char in spots. Continue to cook, turning often until the chicken is cooked through and has an internal temperature of 165℉ / 74℃.
        If the chicken is getting too charred before it is cooked in the center, transfer to a foil lined baking sheet, and place in a 375℉ / 190℃ oven to finish cooking through.
        Let rest at room temperature for about 5 minutes before dicing and serving.
    </p>
    
    <h4>For The Black Beans</h4>
    <h5>Step 4</h5>
    <p>
        In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add vegetable oil or enough cooking spray to coat the bottom of the pan. Once hot add the onion, serrano, and tomato. Season to taste with salt and sauté until the vegetables begin to soften, about 2-3 minutes.
        Stir in the black beans, stock, and more salt to taste. Bring to a boil over medium high, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the vegetables are softened and the stock is reduced by about a quarter.
        Remove from heat and stir in the garlic. Keep warm until ready to serve.
    </p>
    
    <h4>For The Corn Relish</h4>
    <h5>Step 5</h5>
    <p>
        Place the corn cobs directly over an open flame on the stovetop or on a hot grill to char on all sides, turning every 1-2 minutes. Remove to a plate to cool slightly.
        Add the jalapeños to the open flame or grill and char every part of the pepper, so you no longer see any green. Remove to a cutting board to allow to cool slightly.
        Remove the corn kernels from the cob and place in a large bowl.
        Use a paper towel to rub off the charred skin from the jalapeño. Remove the seeds, if you’d like a more mild relish, and then finely dice. Add the jalapeño to the corn kernels along with the red onion and cilantro and toss to combine.
        Season the relish with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in 1 tablespoon of vinegar, again taste and adjust the seasoning with more vinegar, salt and pepper as needed. Set aside until ready to use.
    </p>
    
    <h4>For The Spicy Mayo</h4>
    <h5>Step 6</h5>
    <p>
        This mayo is optional to make and not included in the nutritional values but is delicious!
        Add all the ingredients to a bowl and whisk to combine. Season with salt to taste. Refrigerate until ready to use. For a nice presentation, put the mayo in a squeeze bottle before serving.
    </p>
    
    <h4>To Assemble</h4>
    <p>Divide the rice between six bowls, about 1 cup of rice per bowl. Top each bowl with 1 diced chicken thigh, corn relish topped with spicy mayo, if using, black beans, pickled red onions, ¼ cup shredded cheese, if using, and cilantro for garnish. Enjoy!</p>
