    <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>

    <h5>For The Long French Roll</h5>
    <h6>Step 1</h6>
    <p>
        To a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook add the water, yeast and sugar and stir to dissolve. Let sit for 1-2 minutes.
        Add in the vegetable oil, half of the flour and the salt. Mix on low speed to incorporate the flour and then add in the remaining half of flour. Mix again to combine, if the dough seems dry add a splash of water.
        Mix for 3-5 minutes until smooth. Remove to a clean work surface and roll into a tight ball.
        Add the dough to a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise, at room temperature, for 1-1 ½ hours or until doubled in size.
        Punch down your dough, turn it onto a floured work surface, and divide into 4 even pieces. Shape each into a light ball and place on a sheet pan. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <h6>Step 2</h6>
    <p>
        Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Working with one piece of dough at a time, form it into an oval. Next, fold it over and pinch the sides together. Roll it into a 16 x 3-inch log. Place on a parchment lined sheet pan. Repeat with a second piece of dough and add it to the same sheet pan, evenly spaced out from the other dough. Repeat with the remaining two pieces of dough on a second parchment lined sheet pan.
        Flatten the logs slightly and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for 45 minutes.
        Preheat oven to 375℉ / 190℃.
        Spray loaves lightly with water. You can also lightly slash the dough with a sharp knife over the tops on a diagonal at 3-4-inch intervals.
        Bake for 25-30 minutes or until deep golden brown on the tops and bottoms. Cool completely.
        When ready to serve, cut the ends off, and divide each roll into 2 evenly sized pieces.
    </p>

    <h5>For The Chicago Style Hot Giardiniera</h5>
    <p>
        In a saucepan over medium-high heat add vinegar, water, salt, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt, and then remove from heat.
        Place banana peppers, carrots, celery, and serrano pepper in a heat-proof container and pour the hot pickling liquid over the top.
        Stir in the olive oil to evenly combine.
        To a piece of cheesecloth, add the oregano, peppercorns, and celery seeds. Wrap tightly and secure with a piece of kitchen twine. Add the sachet to the liquid and submerge. Cover and let the mixture come to room temperature before refrigerating.
    </p>

    <h5>For The Beef Stock</h5>
    <p>
        Preheat oven to 475℉ / 246℃. Line a sheet pan with foil.
        Add the oxtail and beef bones evenly on the pan and spray generously with cooking spray. Bake until deeply browned all over, about 30-45 min.
        Add the roasted bones to a large pot along with the onions, celery, carrots, and peppercorns. Cover the bones with cold water and set over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3-4 hours or until reduced and the stock has developed a deep, rich flavor.
        Strain your broth through a fine mesh strainer and reserve.
    </p>

    <h5>For The Beef</h5>
    <h6>Step 1</h6>
    <p>
        Preheat oven to 350℉ / 177℃.
        Heat a 7-8 quart Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan.
        While the oil heats, dry the beef well with paper towels and season generously on both sides with salt and pepper.
        When the oil is nearly smoking, add the seasoned beef and sear for 2-3 minutes per side, or until deeply golden brown all over.
        Pour enough of the homemade beef stock into the pot so that the beef is nearly submerged.
        Stir in the remaining ingredients to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and then cover with a lid. Transfer to the oven and bake for about 1 hour or until the internal temperature reaches 130-135℉ / 54-57℃.
        Remove the beef and let cool to room temperature. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight to cool completely. Let the braising liquid and all the solids come to room temperature as well before refrigerating.
        Once your beef is thoroughly chilled, slice it as thinly as possible, ideally using a deli meat slicer.
        Strain the braising liquid into a large pan, heat until it's at a bare simmer, and add all your sliced meat to warm through before serving.
