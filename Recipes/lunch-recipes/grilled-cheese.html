    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>2 slices milk bread (or your favorite white bread)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Method:</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Set a 10-inch nonstick pan over medium heat. Once hot, add one tablespoon of butter and once melted, place one slice of bread in the butter to toast, making sure it’s fully coated. Top with both slices of American cheese and your second slice of bread.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Reduce the heat to medium-low and toast until the bottom slice of bread is golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.  Add the remaining butter to the pan and once melted, flip the sandwich and toast until golden brown, another 2-3 minutes. You can flip the sandwich again if you want the bread even darker or add a lid if you find the cheese isn’t melting enough for your liking. Remove your sandwich from the plan, slice on the diagonal, and serve and enjoy.
