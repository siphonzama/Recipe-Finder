    <ol>
        <li>baking spray with flour</li>
        <li>2 (16 1/2-ounce) packages refrigerated break-and-bake chocolate chip cookie dough (such as Nestlé Toll House)</li>
        <li>2 (14-ounce) cans sweetened condensed mil</li>k
        <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1 tablespoon pats, divided</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li> 
    </ol>
    


    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
        Spray a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with baking spray; line bottom and sides with parchment paper, leaving a 1- to 2-inch overhang on long sides.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
        Break apart dough squares along perforations and evenly scatter in bottom of the prepared pan. Let stand at room temperature until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Using a sheet of plastic wrap placed directly on surface, press dough into an even layer in the bottom of the pan. Remove and discard plastic wrap.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean or with just some moist crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack while making filling.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
        Add condensed milk, brown sugar, corn syrup, salt, and 1 cup of the butter to a large saucepan; cook over medium, whisking constantly, until butter is melted and mixture starts to bubble, about 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
        Continue to cook, whisking constantly, over medium until mixture is a caramel color, thickened, and registers 235°F on a candy or instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla until combined.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
        Working quickly, pour caramel over cookie layer, spreading into an even layer with a small offset spatula. Chill in refrigerator, uncovered, until set, about 1 hour.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>
        Add chocolate, cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a medium, heatproof bowl; place bowl over  a saucepan filled with 1 inch of simmering water, making sure bottom of bowl does not touch water. Cook, stirring constantly, until chocolate mixture is melted and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 9</h4>
    <p>
        Working quickly, pour and spread chocolate mixture evenly over caramel layer. Chill in refrigerator, uncovered, until set, about 1 hour.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 10</h4>
    <p>
        Using parchment paper as handles, remove from pan and place on a cutting board. Using a warm, dry, sharp knife, cut into bars; wipe knife clean with a damp paper towel between cuts, if desired. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 5 days.
