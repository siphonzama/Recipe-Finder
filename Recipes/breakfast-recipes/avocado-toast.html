<ol>
    <li>tbsp pumpkin seed</li> 
    <li>85g chorizo sliced into chunks</li>
    <li>1 large ripe avocado stoned and peeled</li>
    <li>juice ½ lime</li>

    <li>4 thick-cut slices wholemeal bread</li>
</ol>



<h3>Methods</h3>

<h4>step 1</h4>
<p>
    Heat a large frying pan, add the pumpkin seeds and toast for a few mins until they crack and pop, then tip out into a bowl and set aside. Add the chorizo and cook for 5 mins until it releases some of its oils and becomes crisp. Meanwhile, roughly mash the avocado with the lime juice, half the coriander and a pinch of salt.

<h4>step 2</h4>
<p>
    Heat a griddle pan and cook the bread for a few mins each side, or pop in the toaster. Push the chorizo to the edge of the frying pan, crack in the eggs and fry to your liking.
</p>

<h4>step 3</h4>
<p>To serve, divide the toast between 2 plates, spread with the mashed avocado, and pile on the chorizo, fried eggs and pumpkin seeds. Scatter with the remaining coriander.
