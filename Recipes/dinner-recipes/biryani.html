    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>


    <h4>For The Biryani Masala Powder</h4>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 350℉ / 177℃.
        Add the coriander, shah jeera, cloves, cardamom, star anise, fennel, peppercorns, and cinnamon to a sheet pan in an even layer. Bake for 5-7 minutes or until toasted and fragrant.
        Place the toasted spices in a mortar and pestle and crush into a coarse powder. Alternatively, you can place the spices in a zip top bag and use the back of a pan or rolling pin to crush the spices.
        Add the crushed spices to a blender along with the bay leaf, nutmeg and mace. Blend until the mixture becomes a fine powder. Pass through a fine mesh sieve to remove any larger pieces and set aside.
    </p>

    <h4>For The Chicken Marinade</h4>
    <p>
        In a large bowl, add all the ingredients and mix to coat thoroughly. It can be used right away or, ideally, marinated overnight.
    </p>

    <h4>For The Fried Onions</h4>
    <p>
        In a 12-inch sauté pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat to 325℉ / 163℃. Have a sheet pan lined with a wire rack near the hot oil.
        Add the onions in 2 batches, so as not to overcrowd the oil, and stir occasionally until crispy and light golden brown. Drain on the wire rack and season immediately with salt to taste.
        Repeat with the second batch of onions and set aside. 
    </p>

    <h4>For The Rice</h4>
    <p>
        Start by washing and rinsing the rice three times or until the water runs clear. After the rice is rinsed, soak it in cold water for 30 minutes. Drain the rice and set aside. 
        In a medium pot, add the water, spices, salt and oil and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Add in the soaked rice and cook until the rice is about 75% cooked through, it should still have a bite to it, about 2-4 minutes. Drain the rice and set aside.
    </p>

    <h5>To Assemble and Bake</h5>
    <p>
        In a small saucepan heat the milk and saffron over medium heat until simmering. Remove from heat and set aside to steep.
        In a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pot.
        Add all of the chicken and marinade to the pot, followed by three quarters of the chopped cilantro and mint and 2 tablespoons of melted ghee. Top that with three quarters of the fried onions and stir to evenly combine everything. Season with more salt, if necessary.
        Top the mixture with half of the drained rice, half of the remaining cilantro, mint and fried onions, sprinkle of homemade masala powder, and lemon juice.
        Top that with the remaining drained rice, cilantro, mint and fried onions.
        Strain the steeped saffron milk through a fine mesh strainer and evenly pour over the assembled biryani. Top that with the remaining ¼ cup of melted ghee.
        Cover the pot with foil and then a tight fitting lid.
        Set a cast iron skillet, that the biryani pot fits inside of, over medium heat. Once hot, place the pot on top of the skillet. Cook for 15 minutes and then reduce the heat to low. Cook for 20-30 minutes or until the chicken is lightly charred on the bottom and cooked through and the rice is tender.
        Plate the biryani, topping it with a couple drumsticks. Garnish with more mint and cilantro and serve with the dahi chutney and raita.
