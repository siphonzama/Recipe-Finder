    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
    <h4>Rice Method:</h4>
    <p>
        Before cooking the rice, wash thoroughly 2x.
    Place into a rice cooker and add equal parts of water.
    Cook until rice is fully cooked.
    </p>

    <h4>Beef Method:</h4>
    <p>
        Slice the flank steak into Â½-inch thick slices. Freeze for 15-20 minutes prior to help with cutting. Add slices to a medium bowl.
        Season the wok with 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat, swirling occasionally, until the oil begins to smoke. Discard that oil and wipe it out with a paper towel.
        Add another 3-4 tablespoons of oil and heat again over medium-high.
        While the oil heats, toss the beef together with cornstarch, ground white pepper, and a pinch of salt.
        Once the oil is hot, shake off the excess starch from the beef and shallow each piece of beef in batches for 2-3 minutes per side. Place to the side as they finish browning.
        Leave the heat on medium-high and add in green onions that have been cut into 2-inch segments. Sear for 30 seconds, toss and sear again until caramelization forms.
        Add in finely chopped ginger, thinly sliced Fresno chiles and gochugaru. Stir fry for 45 seconds.
        Add brown sugar, stir fry that in then add dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, water, and a splash of rice vinegar. Let boil and reduce for 3 minutes.
        Add in the beef, and toss and stir to coat thoroughly.
        Turn off the heat and add in thai basil and finely chopped garlic. Stir to combine.
    </p>

    <h4>Broccoli Method:</h4>
    <p>
        Break broccoli into separate florets onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
        Coat with oil and roast 425F until browned and lightly crisped.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Assembly:</h4>
    <p>
        Into a bowl, heavily add the steamed rice.<br />
        Top the rice with the cooked beef with extra sauce.<br />
        Top with thinly shaved green onions with a side of broccoli and serve.
