Hi, my name is Sipho. I built this project to show and test my understanding of HTML and CSS concepts. In this project, I used a lot of the basic skills and concepts of these languages in order to both showcase my knowledge and test my own understanding of them. 

I have built a website featuring healthy recipes designed to make it easy for people to find delicious, nutritious meals quickly. This project serves as a solid foundation that I will continue to enhance as I expand my knowledge in web development. With each improvement, I am confident that the user experience will become even better, reflecting my growing expertise in this area.

In the project, I used list items, most HTML tags, and core concepts of CSS to style all pages and build a basic website. I also used selectors (both element and class ) to appropriately style all the elements and make it easy to group similar items. 

I also use ChatGPT as well as Gemini to better understand errors as well as to test if solutions would work, i did learn that prompting is super important when it comes to using these tools because that can be the only fact to determine if you find a solution to your problem or not. I also used Discord to talk to people who are also working on their projects who helped me come up with better ways of problem-solving 

as well as teach me important tips when using channels like Discord or Stack Overflow to get help better and faster.

I am currently doing a Udmey course on web development thats given by Dr. Angela Yu, Developer, which will cover topics like Front-End Web Development.

So far it has been such a great learning journey to build  smaller projects to test concepts as well as try to use them and see how to break and fix code to make it work as you intend as well as change the way I think about solving problems and learning how to break them into steps that are easy to manage as well as implement
